# CardGame
A simple card game for a CS102 homework assignment. This was my submission for the homework assignmet. 

CS102 - CardGame homework
=========================
Spring 2015 (David Davenport)

This folder contains all the classes for the card game we designed in lectures.
It also contains a DrJava project file. 
If you are using a different IDE, simply copy the .java files as necessary.

You can find the lecture slides with the design online at 
http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~david/cs102/classmaterials/CS102_CardGame.ppt

Our task was to complete the game. 

The instructions: 
First make sure the project compiles
and the CardGameTest class runs (ignore MyCardGame until everything else is working). 
Take a look at each of the Java classes, see how they correspond to the design. 
You will see many methods are left for you "ToDo" -- that's your homework!

If you have any questions related to this homework, please ask on the course forum.

good luck,

David.

Edit: We miss you, David. Rest in peace.
